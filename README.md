## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned on how to make resonsive images using the `<picture>` element, making the card responsive by using grid and flexbox for larger screens which was one of my setbacks with this project. I've also learned on how to easily add icons using the `data-icon="shopping-cart"` and adding it into  the `<button>` element and styling the icon in CSS using the `::before` attribute.
